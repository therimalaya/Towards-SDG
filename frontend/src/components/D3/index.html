    <h1><i>Les Misérables</i> Co-occurrence</h1>

    <aside style="margin-top:80px;">

        <select id="order">
          <option value="name">by Name</option>

      <p>This matrix diagram visualizes character co-occurrences in Victor Hugo’s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Misérables">Les Misérables</a></i>.

      </p>
      <p>Each colored cell represents two characters that appeared in the same chapter; darker cells indicate characters that co-occurred more frequently.

      </p>
      <p>Use the drop-down menu to reorder the matrix and explore the data.

    <p>A network can be represented by an <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a></i>, where each cell <i>ij</i> represents an edge from vertex <i>i</i> to vertex <i>j</i>. Here, vertices represent characters in a book, while edges represent co-occurrence in a chapter.

    </p>
    <p>Given this two-dimensional representation of a graph, a natural visualization is to show the matrix! However, the effectiveness of a matrix diagram is heavily dependent on the order of rows and columns: if related nodes are placed closed to each other, it is easier to identify clusters and bridges.

    </p>
    <p>This example lets you try different orderings via the drop-down menu. This type of diagram can be extended with manual reordering of rows and columns, and expanding or collapsing of clusters, to allow deeper exploration. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Bertin">Jacques Bertin</a> (or more specifically, his fleet of assistants) did this by hand with paper strips.

    </p>
    <p>While path-following is harder in a matrix view than in a <a href="https://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/force.html">node-link diagram</a>, matrices have other advantages. As networks get large and highly connected, node-link diagrams often devolve into giant hairballs of line crossings. Line crossings are impossible with matrix views. Matrix cells can also be encoded to show additional data; here color depicts clusters computed by a community-detection algorithm.
