        <p>
          Welcome to the NMBU SDG-mapping portal. NMBU contributes substantially
          to the fulfilment of the SDGs and Agenda 2030 through research,
          education and innovation. This portal is constructed to increase the
          awareness of these contributions and to give support to further
          education, dissemination and collaboration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Agenda 2030 with its 17 main goals and 169 sub-goals expresses a
          complex system of interdependent challenges. It is therefore crucial
          that we manage to bring attention to the interactions (synergies and
          trade-offs) between the goals in order to provide balanced and science
          based advise to decision- and policy makers. This portal therefore
          aims at tracking how we at NMBU work with these interactions in our
          courses and research papers.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the next few pages you are asked to provide some basic information
          on the SDG-relevance of your work. The SDG-map of NMBU, which will be
          an output from this portal, depends on your input and your
          contribution.

              In the education portal you may, as course responsible, register
              your course(s). Primarily you are asked to register current
              teaching, but also historical activity is welcomed. Here is an
              instruction video showing how courses may be registered.

              In the research portal you may register as many main author
              contributions as you like. Primarily we ask you to focus on papers
              published or accepted for publication in the period 2011-2020, but
              also older publications are welcomed. Here is an instruction video
              showing how publications may be registered.
